# Overview of Joke API Message Extension

## Build API Plugin from OpenAPI Spec

The plugin allows Teams to interact directly with third-party data, apps, and services, enhancing its capabilities and broadening its range of capabilities. Plugins allow Teams to:

- Retrieve real-time information, for example, latest news coverage on a product launch.
- Retrieve knowledge-based information, for example, my teamâ€™s design files in Figma.
